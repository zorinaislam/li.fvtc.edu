WFAA reported Wednesday that the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 AT&amp;T Stadium was contacted.<\/p>\n<p>In reply to the pandemic, the NFL underlined that it still aims to hold the Super Bowl in Los Angeles and that it studies prospective backup venues every year. This state has stricter COVID-19 rules, and the Los Angeles County administration has been known to add additional limitations on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Sofi Stadium is expecting a capacity crowd of at least 70,000 people for the Super Bowl next month.<\/p>\n<p>An indoor masks rule in California has been extended until February 15th, two days after the Super Bowl, by the state of California. In Los Angeles County, public gatherings with more than 10,000 attendees already mandate the use of face masks.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers have played all season at SoFi Stadium, both clubs have taken extra precautions related to the current viral spike. A negative COVID-19 test or evidence of vaccination is needed for all spectators over the age of five who desire to enter the stadium.<\/p>\n<p>Last Super Bowl in Los Angeles: 1993. Although SoFi Stadium has not yet been completed when it got the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl proposal in 2016, building has already begun.<\/p>\n<p>Late last week, Yahoo Sports asked the California Department of Public Health how bad the Omicron illness had to grow before COVID-19 limitations were enforced. A commitment to hosting the Super Bowl in Los Angeles was made public on Wednesday by California Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/board.coveredca.com\/board-members\/dr-mark-ghaly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr. Mark Ghaly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the global spike in COVID-19, the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, is expected to be sold out for Super Bowl LVI on February 13.<\/p>\n<p>To host the Super Bowl, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health released a statement to Yahoo Sports. He went on to remark that in the future, \u201cwe do not foresee capacity limitations at athletic events\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>SoFi Stadium can hold up to 100,000 fans for important events like the Super Bowl.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, WFAA reported that the NFL was examining AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, as a backup Super Bowl location if local COVID regulations barred SoFi Stadium from hosting the game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe league did ask about a date,\u201d a Cowboys insider told Leslie. \u201cHowever, that is the sole instance of such in my research. There is a possibility that they are prepared for the worst possible outcome.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to NFL VP of Communications Brian McCarthy, the league is routinely reviewing backup plans:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSoFi Stadium is set to host\u00a0Super Bowl LVI on Sunday, February 13th. We have contacted many teams to enquire about stadium availability in the event that we cannot play the Super Bowl as scheduled due to weather-related difficulties or unanticipated incidents. This year\u2019s Super Bowl will be held in Los Angeles, capping off another memorable NFL season for local fans and teams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Department of Health and Human Services, says the Super Bowl is coming to Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>All evidence lead to the Super Bowl being hosted in Los Angeles as scheduled.<\/p>\n<p>Due of the epidemic, barely 25,000 people attended last year\u2019s Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Super Bowl will be sold out, according to officials in Los Angeles County.
