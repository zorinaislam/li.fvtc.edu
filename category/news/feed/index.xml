										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Super Bowl will be sold out, according to officials in Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>At the Super Bowl next month, the NFL most likely won’t need cardboard cutouts to fill the stands.</p>
<p>COVID-19 infection rates are growing in the neighborhood and over the country due to the Omicron variant epidemic, but LA County does not anticipate to restrict sports attendance.</p>
<p>Yahoo Sports was notified on Thursday by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health that it is working closely with the NFL to host the Super Bowl. “We don’t expect capacity concerns during athletic events,” the group said, despite the uncertain future.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County and the NFL have both committed to look at other options if SoFi Stadium cannot host the Super Bowl as planned. WFAA reported Wednesday that the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&amp;T Stadium was contacted.</p>
<p>In reply to the pandemic, the NFL underlined that it still aims to hold the Super Bowl in Los Angeles and that it studies prospective backup venues every year. This state has stricter COVID-19 rules, and the Los Angeles County administration has been known to add additional limitations on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Sofi Stadium is expecting a capacity crowd of at least 70,000 people for the Super Bowl next month.</p>
<p>An indoor masks rule in California has been extended until February 15th, two days after the Super Bowl, by the state of California. In Los Angeles County, public gatherings with more than 10,000 attendees already mandate the use of face masks.</p>
<p>Although the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers have played all season at SoFi Stadium, both clubs have taken extra precautions related to the current viral spike. A negative COVID-19 test or evidence of vaccination is needed for all spectators over the age of five who desire to enter the stadium.</p>
<p>Last Super Bowl in Los Angeles: 1993. Although SoFi Stadium has not yet been completed when it got the NFL’s Super Bowl proposal in 2016, building has already begun.</p>
<p>Late last week, Yahoo Sports asked the California Department of Public Health how bad the Omicron illness had to grow before COVID-19 limitations were enforced. A commitment to hosting the Super Bowl in Los Angeles was made public on Wednesday by California Department of Health and Human Services Secretary <a href="https://board.coveredca.com/board-members/dr-mark-ghaly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mark Ghaly</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the global spike in COVID-19, the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, is expected to be sold out for Super Bowl LVI on February 13.</p>
<p>To host the Super Bowl, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health released a statement to Yahoo Sports. He went on to remark that in the future, “we do not foresee capacity limitations at athletic events”.</p>
<p>SoFi Stadium can hold up to 100,000 fans for important events like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, WFAA reported that the NFL was examining AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, as a backup Super Bowl location if local COVID regulations barred SoFi Stadium from hosting the game.</p>
<p>“The league did ask about a date,” a Cowboys insider told Leslie. “However, that is the sole instance of such in my research. There is a possibility that they are prepared for the worst possible outcome.”</p>
<p>According to NFL VP of Communications Brian McCarthy, the league is routinely reviewing backup plans:</p>
<p>“SoFi Stadium is set to host Super Bowl LVI on Sunday, February 13th. We have contacted many teams to enquire about stadium availability in the event that we cannot play the Super Bowl as scheduled due to weather-related difficulties or unanticipated incidents. This year’s Super Bowl will be held in Los Angeles, capping off another memorable NFL season for local fans and teams.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Department of Health and Human Services, says the Super Bowl is coming to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>All evidence lead to the Super Bowl being hosted in Los Angeles as scheduled.</p>
<p>Due of the epidemic, barely 25,000 people attended last year’s Super Bowl in Tampa, Florida.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the NFL playoff format &amp; How does it Work?</h2>
<p>Single-elimination playoffs are held following the regular season in the NFL. Each conference currently has seven teams in the playoffs. Breaking connections can be done in a certain way.</p>
<p>The NFL Playoffs include 14 teams. The NFL Playoff Bracket has seven teams from the American Football Conference and seven from the National Football Conference. Each conference has four divisions, and the top two teams from each division advance to the playoffs. Teams will be seeded 1–4, depending on their record. (1 seed) has the best record and has the advantage of playing at home. When it comes to conference tournaments, only the top two seeds receive a first-round bye.</p>
<p>The Wild Card Round will include the top three teams from each division. The best wild card team faces the fourth-seeded club from the division winner’s conference. They will be seeded 7th and 6th, meeting the division winners’ 2nd and 3rd seeds. Each league has three wild card teams.</p>
<p>The NCAA Tournament and the NBA Playoffs have “real” brackets, while the NFL does not. In a “true” bracket, the team that wins each game advances to the next round. In the second round of the NFL playoffs, the highest seed in each conference matches the lowest seed left in that conference.</p>
<p>Unless you remove the bracket, it will remain there. Here’s an example of a second-round shuffle in an NFL playoff bracket.</p>
